  title: About
  summary: |
    Hello, I am Dhvanil, a UG 4th year at IIT Bombay in the CSE department. I am highly interested in research in Formal Verification, Game Theory and Programming Languages and enjoy reading research papers in these fields. I am currently working with [Prof. Supratik Chakraborty](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~supratik/) and [Prof S. Akshay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akshayss/) on Skolem Synthesis and [Prof. Swaprava Nath](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/) on Intermediary Network Auctions.

    You can [download my resume/CV here](https://github.com/Dhvanil-CSE/personal-site/raw/master/resume.pdf).

    I am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in the fields of Computer Science, and learn new perspectives by collaborating with others. I want to get better at presenting my work and ideas. I am a huge hodophile! and large fan of mystery/thriller and rich character driven stories whether it’s in a book, a movie, or a game. A windy day with good music? That’s my bliss. I believe the work done today by us will shape the future.

    For Those Who Come After!
