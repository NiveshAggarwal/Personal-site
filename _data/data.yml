  summary: |
  
    Hello, I am Nivesh, a UG 4th year at IIT Bombay in the CSE department. I am highly interested in reasearch in CryptoGraphy and Game Theory and enjoy learning new things in these fields. I am currently working with [Prof. Chetan Kamath](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ckamath/) on Timed Cryptographic Primitives and [Prof. Swaprava Nath](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/) on Intermediary Network Auctions.

    You can [download my resume/CV here](Resume-Nivesh_Aggarwal.pdf).

    I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself. I love traveling and exploring new places, meeting new people and learning about their cultures. I am a huge nature lover and food enthusiast. My idea of a perfect day is a refreshing morning trek followed by a hearty meal and good music. I believe in living each moment to its fullest and always trying your best, as that's the best anyone can do.
