  summary: |
  
    Hello, I am Nivesh, a UG 4th year at IIT Bombay in the CSE department. I am highly interested in reasearch in CryptoGraphy and Game Theory and enjoy learning new things in these fields. I am currently working with [Prof. Chetan Kamath](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ckamath/) on Timed Cryptographic Primitives and [Prof. Swaprava Nath](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/) on Intermediary Network Auctions.

    You can [download my resume/CV here](https://github.com/NiveshAggarwal/personal-site/raw/master/Resume_Nivesh_Aggarwal.pdf).

    I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself. I love traveling and exploring new places, meeting new people and learning about their cultures. I am a huge nature lover and food enthusiast. My idea of a perfect day is a refreshing morning trek followed by a hearty meal and good music. I believe in living each moment to its fullest and always trying your best, as that's the best anyone can do.

  title: Experiences
  info:
    - role: Separating Verifiable Delay Functions and Time-Lock Puzzles
      time: Jan 2025 – Present
      company: IIT Bombay
      details: |
          - Fine-tuned and distilled Whisper models for low-resource ASR using high-resource     counterparts, pseudolabeling, and subsampling; evaluated against zero-shots while experimenting with encoder freezing and WER thresholds
          - Improved Whisper's transcription accuracy by integrating n-gram KenLM and StableLM (StabilityAI) to rescore top-k beam outputs, and enhanced the model by incorporating secondary labels as prompts to guide decoding
          - Studied the construction of Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) and Time-Lock Puzzles (TLPs), under guidance of Prof. Chetan Kamath
          - Came up with a novel oracle construction to seperate VDFs from TLPs and TLPs from VDFs and proved that it satisfies the required properties

    - role: Revenue Maximising in Intermediary Network Auctions
      time: Jan 2025 – Present
      company: IIT Bombay
      details: |
        - Modeled the problem using graphs and Bayesian settings, specifying type distributions and valuation functions
        - Designed mechanisms for line and star graphs using Myerson’s optimal auction theory
        - Proved hardness of general auction design in tree networks by reducing from UDMO

    - role: Quantitative Trader
      time: Summer 2025
      company: Graviton Research Capital
      details: |
        - Worked on improving non linear model training pipeline by normalizing the input features given and optimising loss functions achieving an improvement of 2 percent
        - Explored and identified additional areas with potential for improvement, conducting brief proof-of-concept
        experiments that yielded improvements of 1-2 percent and documented the findings for future reference
        - Worked on a simulator for testing models, allowing us to compare them faster and provide more flexibility
